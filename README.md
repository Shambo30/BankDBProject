Part A and B of our second Distributed Computing project. Our task is to create a bank data web service in ASP.NET MVC Core that uses SQLite to store data locally.
## Profiles
Use this JSON to test profile CRUD operations:
```
{
    "Username" : "johndoe",
    "Email" : "johndoe@fake.com",
    "Password" : "test123",
    "Name" : "John Doe",
    "Address" : "123 Main Street",
    "Phone" : "1234567890",
    "Picture" : "testing"
}
```
